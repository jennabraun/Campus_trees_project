## Campus tree dynamics
An exploration of tree health, consumer pressure, and disturbance. A long-term tree census [dataset](https://search.dataone.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF13F4MZC) is reused here to examine change through time and explore potential key drivers.  

### Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#long-term
data <- read_csv("data/tree_sub.csv") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(Date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))

df <-  data %>% 
  select(7, 10:11, DBH, 18, 32, 30, 28, year) %>% 
  rename(ID = 1, species = 2, genus = 3, crown_width = 5, conks = 6, scars = 7,
  branch_health = 8) 

df <- df %>% 
  pivot_longer(!c(1:3, 9), names_to = "measure", values_to = "values")

spp <- df %>% 
  select(ID, species, genus)


#read in 2020 and add year vector also need rename ID to match
pilot <- read_csv("data/pilot.csv")

pilot <- pilot %>% 
  select(1, 3:9)

pilot <- pilot %>% 
  rename(ID = 1, species = 2, DBH = 3, crown_width = 4, conks = 5, scars = 6,
  branch_health = 8) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2020) %>% 
  select(-2)

pilot <- left_join(pilot, spp) %>% 
  select(ID, species, genus, year, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(DBH = as.numeric(DBH))


pilot_df <- pilot %>% 
  pivot_longer(!c(1:4), names_to = "measure", values_to = "values")

df_all <- bind_rows(df, pilot_df)
  

#now need to make long format to join or keep year and do bind cols
