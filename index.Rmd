## Campus tree dynamics
An exploration of tree health, consumer pressure, and disturbance. A long-term tree census [dataset](https://search.dataone.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF13F4MZC) is reused here to examine change through time and explore potential key drivers.  

### Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#long-term
data <- read_csv("data/YorkUTreeMap.csv")

#need to tidy dates
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(Date))

#data <- data %>% 
  #mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>% 
  #mutate(year = year(Date))


#read in 2020 and add year vector also need rename ID to match
pilot <- read_csv("data/pilot.csv") %>% 
  mutate(year = "2020")

```
